[HYPERBEATS PROJECT CONTEXT]

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Current ecosystem monitoring is fragmented and manual:
- Manual metric collection from repos: tedious
- Static dashboards: lag behind reality
- No shareable widgets for READMEs
- Developers cannot showcase their metrics
- Community lacks visibility into real activity

RESULT: Poor transparency, slow decision-making, no real-time ecosystem insights

## 2. GOAL

Build Hyperbeats: Real-time activity monitoring and visualization platform for HyperKit ecosystem metrics.

Target outcomes:
- Aggregate activity data from multiple blockchain repositories
- Render SVG/PNG charts with customizable themes
- Serve embeddable widgets via HTTP endpoints
- Cache results for high performance
- Update in real-time as new data arrives

## 3. SUCCESS METRICS

Performance Targets:
- API latency: under 500ms (first request)
- SVG rendering: under 200ms
- PNG rendering: under 1000ms
- Cache hit rate: above 85%
- API uptime: 99.5%+

Business Targets:
- Daily active users tracking
- Popular repos tracked
- API calls per day
- Storage usage optimization

## 4. CORE VISION & MISSION

Vision: Provide the visualization and monitoring backbone for the HyperKit ecosystem, enabling developers to track, visualize, and share their ecosystem growth.

Mission: Transform ecosystem monitoring from static dashboards to real-time, shareable, embeddable visualizations.

Hyperbeats Path:
1. Input: List GitHub repos to track
2. Generate chart: Use API endpoint with repos parameter
3. Customize: Apply theme and format preferences
4. Embed: Copy chart URL to README/dashboard
5. Monitor: Watch real-time updates of your ecosystem
